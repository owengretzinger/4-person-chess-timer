## Architecture
The Multiplayer Clock is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:**
    - **Next.js:** A React framework for building performant web applications.
    - **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
    - **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **State Management:**
    - **React Hooks:** `useState` and `useEffect` are used for managing component state and side effects, including the timer logic.
- **Utilities:**
    - **formatters.ts:** Contains utility functions for formatting time.
    - **wheelCalculator.ts:** Contains utility functions for calculating the layout of the player wheel.
